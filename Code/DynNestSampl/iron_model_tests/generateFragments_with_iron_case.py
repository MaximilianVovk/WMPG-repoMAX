    Masses are binned and one daughter fragment may represent several fragments/grains, which is specified 
    with the n_grains atribute.

    Arguments:
        const: [object] Constants instance.
        frag_parent: [object] Fragment instance, the parent fragment.
        eroded_mass: [float] Mass to be distributed into daughter fragments. 
        mass_index: [float] Mass index to use to distribute the mass.
        mass_min: [float] Minimum mass bin (kg).
        mass_max: [float] Maximum mass bin (kg).

    Keyword arguments:
        keep_eroding: [bool] Whether the daughter fragments should keep eroding.
        disruption: [bool] Indicates that the disruption occured, uses a separate erosion parameter for
            disrupted daughter fragments.
        iron_model: [bool] Whether to use the iron model for mass distribution.
